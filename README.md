# Wi-I-Cloud
Custom cloud back-end and React-ive front-end view to connect to the Teqcon Sigfox back-end and manage IoT devices for security perimeters.  
Currently we are busy with the first iteration of the project - the **MVP Phase One**.

## Code Initialization and Running
### Prerequisites
You need to have the following installed to run the project:
- npm & node
- ruby on rails (5.1>)
- Database:
  - Dev: sqlite3
  - Prod: postgress

### Local Build and Run
To build and run the code locally (dev environment):

```
yarn install
```
_(or the unrecommended route: `npm install --save`)_

then:

```
rails server
```  

together with webpack for automatic reloads when updating React code (in another terminal):

```
./bin/webpack-dev-server
```  

---

## Deploy to Heroku
### Prerequisites

* Both the Rails and NodeJS heroku buildpacks need to be installed on the heroku dyno. See: [Multiple build packs in Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-multiple-buildpacks-for-an-app)
* The heap memory of the dyno needs to be adjusted for the React libraries to build.
  To do this, run:  
  ```
  heroku config:set NODE_OPTIONS="--max_old_space_size=2560" -a [app_name]
  ```  
  from your terminal (for this the heroku cli must be installed locally and you need to be logged into the correct profile - for more info, see [The Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli))

### Pushing Updates
To push updates to Heroku:

1. Precompile all assets locally:
   ```
   RAILS_ENV=production rake assets:precompile
   ```
2. Precompile webserver assets locally:
   ```
   RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails webpacker:compile
   ```
3. Commit all built assets (for this to work make sure the /public/packs directory is not part of your gitignore file):  
   ```
   git add .; git commit -m 'update: built assets'
   ```
4. Update the remote `master` branch:  
   ```
   git push origin master
   ```
5. Push the `master` branch to heroku:  
   ```
   git push heroku master
   ```

### Note: Problems after Updates
If after an update there are problems like pages not being loaded or being loaded with errors try the following (before logging a bug):

1. In your project directory (local), run:
   ```
   rm -r public
   ```
2. Precompile all assets locally (again):
   ```
   RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails webpacker:compile
   ```
3. Follow steps 3. to 5. in the **Pushing Updates** section above

## API Documentation
### Local
To view the API docs, run the local server and go to the `/documentation` endpoint.  
_(for example: localhost:3000/documentation)_

### Cloud
To view the API docs, open an instance of the cloud server (for example: https://wi-i-cloud.herokuapp.com) and navigate to the `/documentation` endpoint.  
_Click [here](https://wi-i-cloud.herokuapp.com/documentation) to navigate to an instance of the cloud server at the documentation endpoint._
